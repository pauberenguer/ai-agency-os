# AI Visibility & AI SEO Audit — Phase 14

## Executive Summary

AI search is the fastest-growing traffic channel in 2025. Google AI Overviews appear for 20–35% of local service queries (SparkToro 2025). ChatGPT Search has 200M+ monthly active users. Perplexity processes 100M+ queries/month. Being cited in AI answers = significant visibility gain; being absent = invisible to AI-first searchers. This phase audits where the client appears (or doesn't) across all major AI platforms, identifies content gaps causing AI invisibility, and produces a prioritized action plan for AI citation dominance.

**2025 AI search benchmarks:**
- AIO citation rate: pages with FAQPage schema cited 3.2× more than pages without (Amsive 2025)
- ChatGPT freshness: pages updated within 30 days cited at 76.4% rate vs. 31.2% for 90+ day old pages
- Perplexity local query share: 18% of all queries are local business intent (Perplexity data, 2025)
- AIO + organic position 1 = ~45% CTR combined (vs. ~25% for position 1 alone when AIO shows)

## The AI Search Landscape (2025-2026)

AI search is no longer emerging — it IS the mainstream:
- **Google AI Overviews**: Shown for ~20-30% of queries (growing)
- **Google AI Mode**: Full conversational search experience
- **ChatGPT Search**: Now default for 200M+ users with web access
- **Perplexity**: 100M+ monthly queries, growing fast
- **Microsoft Copilot**: Integrated into Windows/Edge/Bing
- **Gemini (Google)**: Deep integration with Android + Google Workspace
- **Claude (Anthropic)**: Growing presence with web search

For local businesses, AI search drives both:
1. Direct visibility (being mentioned in AI answers)
2. Competitive displacement (competitor gets the mention instead)

## Step 1: Read Project Context

Read `{AUDIT_DIR}/intake-data.md` — business name, URL, services, location.
Read `{AUDIT_DIR}/competitor-profiles.md` — competitor AI visibility signals.
Read `{AUDIT_DIR}/onpage-findings.md` — content structure gaps.

## Section 1: Google AI Overviews (AIO) Audit

### Test Protocol
Test top 20-30 target keywords in Google Search (incognito, desktop + mobile):

For each query, document:
| Query | AIO Shows? | Client Cited? | Competitors Cited? | Source URLs Used | AIO Format |
|-------|-----------|--------------|-------------------|-----------------|-----------|
| [query] | Yes/No | Yes/No | [names] | [URLs] | Paragraph/List/Table/Steps |

### AIO Appearance Patterns to Identify
- Which query types trigger AIO? (Informational, local, how-to, comparison?)
- Which content format is used in AIO? (Paragraphs, numbered steps, bullet lists?)
- What's the word count of the cited answer section?
- Does AIO pull from the first paragraph? A specific H2 section?
- Are any client pages cited? If so, which ones and why?

### AIO Optimization Strategy
To be cited in AI Overviews, content needs:
1. **Direct answers** — First 40-60 words answer the query directly
2. **Question-format headers** — H2: "What is [topic]?" / "How does [process] work?"
3. **Structured formatting** — numbered steps, bullet lists, tables rank well
4. **Unique data/insights** — AI cites specific facts, statistics, and expert opinions
5. **E-E-A-T signals** — Strong author credentials, institutional trust
6. **Comprehensive coverage** — Answer main query + related sub-questions
7. **Page authority** — Higher authority pages cited more often

---

## Section 2: Google AI Mode Audit

Google AI Mode (launched 2024, expanding 2025) enables fully conversational search.

### Test AI Mode Queries
- Enable AI Mode (Google account > Experiments or rolled-out region)
- Test conversational queries:
  - "What's the best [service] in [city] and why?"
  - "Compare [client] vs. [competitor 1] for [service]"
  - "I need [service] near [neighborhood] — any recommendations?"
  - Follow-up: "What makes them stand out?"

### Document Findings
| Query | Client Mentioned? | Accuracy | Competitor Priority | Source |
|-------|-----------------|---------|-------------------|--------|

---

## Section 3: LLM Visibility Audit (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, Copilot, Claude)

### Test Matrix
For each platform × query type:

**Platforms to test:**
- ChatGPT (GPT-4o with Search)
- Perplexity
- Google Gemini
- Microsoft Copilot
- Claude.ai (Anthropic)

**Query types to test:**
1. `Best [service] in [city]`
2. `[Service] near [neighborhood/landmark]`
3. `[Business Name]` — accuracy check
4. `[Business Name] reviews` — reputation
5. `How to find a good [service type] in [city]`
6. `[Specific service] cost in [city]`

**For each result document:**
- Business mentioned? (Yes/No)
- Accuracy of info (address, phone, hours, services)?
- Positive/negative framing?
- Competitors mentioned instead?
- Source URLs cited?
- Position (1st mention / 2nd / not mentioned)?

### LLM Visibility Score (per platform)
- Mentioned accurately in top 3 answers: 5/5
- Mentioned but with errors: 3/5
- Mentioned peripherally: 1/5
- Not mentioned: 0/5

---

## Section 4: AEO — Answer Engine Optimization Assessment

AEO focuses on structuring content so AI can extract and use it as answers.

### Content Assessment
For each key service page and FAQ page:
- [ ] Does each section start with a direct, standalone answer?
- [ ] Are definitions provided for key service terms?
- [ ] Are process steps numbered and clearly labeled?
- [ ] Are comparisons structured in tables?
- [ ] Are FAQs in explicit question + answer format (not buried)?
- [ ] Are specific figures, statistics, and data points included?
- [ ] Can the answer be extracted and read without surrounding context?

### FAQ Content Audit
- FAQ page exists?
- FAQs based on real customer questions (not generic)?
- FAQPage schema implemented?
- PAA (People Also Ask) boxes captured with existing content?
- Test: do current FAQs appear in PAA for target queries?

### Featured Snippet Optimization
Since AI Overviews pull from featured snippets:
- Which target queries have featured snippets?
- Does the client own any?
- What format does the winning snippet use?
- What page structure modifications are needed to win it?

---

## Section 5: GEO — Generative Engine Optimization Assessment

GEO focuses on making content easily citable by AI systems.

### Citeability Checklist
- [ ] Specific, quotable statements with data?
  Good: "Chicago homeowners saved an average of $2,400/year after our insulation upgrade"
  Bad: "We help homeowners save money on energy bills"

- [ ] Original research, surveys, or case studies?
- [ ] Named expert quotes with credentials?
- [ ] Step-by-step instructions with clear numbered format?
- [ ] Comparison tables with specific data?
- [ ] Local statistics about the service area?
- [ ] Industry benchmarks stated clearly?

### Source Authority Assessment
AI systems cite authoritative sources. Check:
- Domain authority and trust indicators
- E-E-A-T signals present (author, expertise, experience demonstrated)
- Linked to from other authoritative sources in the niche?
- Consistently mentioned on industry resource pages?

### Entity Optimization for AI
AI systems understand entities better than raw keyword text:
- Is the business entity clearly defined (who, what, where, when)?
- Are service entities named consistently (using industry-standard terminology)?
- Are geographic entities precise (neighborhood, city, region)?
- Do related entities connect? (business → services → location → team)?
- Schema markup reinforces all entity relationships?

---

## Section 6: Structured Data for AI Readability

Schema types most valuable for AI citation:
| Schema Type | AI Benefit |
|------------|-----------|
| LocalBusiness | Business entity establishment |
| FAQPage | Direct Q&A extraction |
| HowTo | Step-by-step answer extraction |
| Article + Author | E-E-A-T, content authority |
| AggregateRating | Trust signal for AI recommendations |
| Speakable | Marks content optimized for voice/AI reading |
| Service | Clear service entity definition |
| Review | Specific review content citation |

## Section 7: Competitor AI Visibility Comparison

| Platform | Client Score | Comp 1 | Comp 2 | Comp 3 |
|----------|-------------|--------|--------|--------|
| Google AIO | | | | |
| ChatGPT Search | | | | |
| Perplexity | | | | |
| Gemini | | | | |
| Copilot | | | | |
| Overall AI Score | | | | |

**Findings:** Which competitor dominates AI visibility and why? What content do they have that the client lacks?

## Section 9: AI Citability Scoring Framework

AI models cite passages that meet specific structural criteria. GEO-optimized content achieves 30–115% higher visibility in AI-generated responses (Georgia Tech / Princeton / IIT Delhi 2024). Optimal AI-cited passages are **134–167 words**, self-contained, fact-rich, and answer-first.

### Citability Rubric (per content block, 0–100)

| Category | Weight | What It Measures | Scoring |
|----------|--------|-----------------|---------|
| Answer Block Quality | 30% | Does the passage open with a direct, quotable answer? Uses "X is..." or answer-first patterns? First 40–60 words stand alone? | 90+: every section opens with 1–2 sentence answer; 50–69: answers buried mid-paragraph; <30: no extractable answers |
| Self-Containment | 25% | Can the passage be extracted without context? No pronoun dependencies? Named subject in every block? | 90+: 80%+ blocks fully standalone; 50–69: mixed pronoun/explicit use; <30: continuous narrative, extraction breaks meaning |
| Structural Readability | 20% | H1>H2>H3 hierarchy? Question-based headings? Short paragraphs (2–4 sentences)? Tables for comparisons? Lists for processes? | 90+: clean hierarchy + question headings + tables/lists; 50–69: some structure; <30: wall-of-text |
| Statistical Density | 15% | Specific stats per 500 words? Named sources? Exact numbers (not "many" or "several")? | 90+: 5+ stats/500w, all sourced; 50–69: 1–2 stats/500w; <30: no statistics, vague quantifiers |
| Uniqueness & Original Data | 10% | First-party research? Proprietary data? Case studies with specific outcomes? | 90+: original surveys/research; 50–69: synthesized with some original commentary; <30: entirely derivative |

**Page Citability Score** = weighted average of all content block scores.

### High vs. Low Citability Examples

**HIGH citability (score ~85):**
> Content delivery networks (CDNs) are distributed server systems that cache and serve web content from locations geographically close to end users. A CDN reduces latency by 50–70% on average by serving assets from edge servers rather than a single origin server. The three largest CDN providers as of 2025 are Cloudflare (serving approximately 20% of all websites), Amazon CloudFront, and Akamai Technologies.
> — 58 words. Self-contained: yes. Facts: 3 specific data points. Definition pattern: yes.

**LOW citability (score ~15):**
> If you've ever wondered why some websites load faster than others, the answer might surprise you. There's this amazing technology that has been around for a while now. It's changed the way we think about web performance. Let me explain how it works.
> — 52 words. Self-contained: no (no topic named). Facts: 0. Definition pattern: no.

### Citation Research Data

| Finding | Source |
|---------|--------|
| Optimal AI-cited passage length: 134–167 words | Bortolato 2025 analysis of AI Overview passages |
| Definition patterns increase citation rate by 2.1× | Georgia Tech 2024 |
| Adding statistics increases citation by 40% | Princeton GEO study 2024 |
| Adding authority quotations increases citation by 115% in some categories | IIT Delhi 2024 |
| Fluency optimization increases visibility by 30% average | Georgia Tech 2024 |
| Content with source citations cited 20–25% more often by Perplexity/ChatGPT | Industry data 2025 |

### AI System Citation Preferences

| AI System | Citation Preference |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Google AI Overviews** | Concise answer blocks (40–60 words). Content already ranking in top 10. Structured formatting (tables, lists). |
| **ChatGPT (Search)** | Explicit definitions, named sources, recent dates. Cites 2–4 sources per response. Wikipedia sourced 47.9% of citations. |
| **Perplexity** | Fact-dense passages with statistics. Cites 4–8 sources per response. Values recency highly. Reddit sourced 46.7% of citations. |
| **Gemini** | Multi-modal (text + images + video). YouTube content weighted heavily. Uses Knowledge Graph for entity grounding. |
| **Copilot (Bing)** | Passages from high-authority domains with clear factual claims. IndexNow for fast indexation. |

### Citability Audit Process

For each key page:
1. Segment content at each H2/H3 heading into blocks
2. Score each block on the 5 categories above
3. Identify top 3 strongest blocks (highlight as strengths)
4. Identify bottom 3 weakest blocks (flag for rewriting)
5. For blocks scoring <60: generate specific rewrite suggestion with answer-first opening + recommended statistics to add
6. Calculate "citability coverage" = % of blocks scoring above 70

---

## Section 10: AI Crawler Access Audit

AI crawlers must be able to access your site — blocked crawlers = invisible to that platform regardless of content quality. Over 35% of top 1,000 websites block at least one major AI crawler (Originality.ai 2025).

### Complete AI Crawler Reference (3 Tiers)

#### Tier 1: Critical for AI Search Visibility (MUST ALLOW)

| Crawler | Operator | User-Agent | Purpose | Impact if Blocked |
|---------|----------|-----------|---------|------------------|
| GPTBot | OpenAI | `GPTBot` | ChatGPT web browsing + search. Content may be used for model improvement. | Invisible in ChatGPT Search (900M+ weekly users) |
| OAI-SearchBot | OpenAI | `OAI-SearchBot` | ChatGPT search only — NOT used for training. | Not in ChatGPT search results even if GPTBot allowed |
| ChatGPT-User | OpenAI | `ChatGPT-User` | User-initiated URL visits ("read this page for me") | Users can't access your content via ChatGPT |
| ClaudeBot | Anthropic | `ClaudeBot` | Claude web search, citations, analysis | Invisible to Claude's web search |
| PerplexityBot | Perplexity | `PerplexityBot` | Perplexity AI search — always displays source links (best referral traffic of AI search products) | No Perplexity citations |

#### Tier 2: Important for Broader AI Ecosystem (RECOMMEND ALLOW)

| Crawler | Operator | User-Agent | Purpose | Notes |
|---------|----------|-----------|---------|-------|
| Google-Extended | Google | `Google-Extended` | Gemini training + AI Overviews improvement. Blocking does NOT affect Google Search ranking or AIO appearance (controlled by Googlebot). | Allow unless philosophical objection to training data usage |
| GoogleOther | Google | `GoogleOther` | Non-search-ranking purposes — research, experimental features | Low risk, moderate benefit |
| Applebot-Extended | Apple | `Applebot-Extended` | Apple Intelligence features, Siri AI (2B+ active Apple devices) | Growing strategic value |
| Amazonbot | Amazon | `Amazonbot` | Alexa answers, Amazon AI features | Relevant for voice search |
| FacebookBot | Meta | `FacebookBot` | Meta AI assistant (3B+ combined app users) | Growing importance |

#### Tier 3: Training-Only (Allow or Block Based on Strategy)

| Crawler | Operator | Recommendation | Reason |
|---------|----------|---------------|--------|
| CCBot | Common Crawl | Context-dependent | Training data for many AI companies. No live search impact. |
| anthropic-ai | Anthropic | Context-dependent | Claude model training only (separate from ClaudeBot live features) |
| Bytespider | ByteDance | **BLOCK** for most Western businesses | Aggressive crawling, minimal benefit outside Asian markets |
| cohere-ai | Cohere | Context-dependent | Enterprise AI training, low consumer impact |

### Crawler Access Audit Process

1. **Fetch robots.txt** — parse all User-agent directives. For each crawler above: Allowed / Blocked / Not Mentioned (inherits wildcard)
2. **Check meta robots tags** — sample 5–10 key pages for `<meta name="robots" content="noai">`, bot-specific noindex
3. **Check HTTP headers** — `X-Robots-Tag: noai`, `X-Robots-Tag: GPTBot: noindex`
4. **Check AI-specific files** — `/llms.txt`, `/.well-known/ai-plugin.json`, `/ai.txt`
5. **Assess JS rendering** — AI crawlers do NOT execute JavaScript. If content requires JS → flag as critical GEO issue

### Recommended robots.txt for Maximum AI Visibility

```
# Tier 1 — AI Search (ALLOW)
User-agent: GPTBot
Allow: /

User-agent: OAI-SearchBot
Allow: /

User-agent: ChatGPT-User
Allow: /

User-agent: ClaudeBot
Allow: /

User-agent: PerplexityBot
Allow: /

# Tier 2 — AI Ecosystem (ALLOW)
User-agent: Google-Extended
Allow: /

User-agent: Applebot-Extended
Allow: /

User-agent: Amazonbot
Allow: /

User-agent: FacebookBot
Allow: /

# Tier 3 — Training Only (BLOCK aggressive)
User-agent: Bytespider
Disallow: /
```

### Crawler Access Score

| Component | Weight |
|-----------|--------|
| Tier 1 crawlers allowed (5 bots) | 50% |
| Tier 2 crawlers allowed (5 bots) | 25% |
| No blanket AI blocks (no `noai` meta, no `User-agent: *` Disallow: /) | 15% |
| AI-specific files present (llms.txt, sitemap accessible) | 10% |

---

## Section 11: llms.txt Audit & Generation

The `llms.txt` standard (proposed by Jeremy Howard, Sept 2024) is an emerging file at `/llms.txt` that helps AI systems understand your site's purpose, structure, and key content. Analogous to `robots.txt` telling crawlers what NOT to access, `llms.txt` tells AI systems what IS most useful. As of early 2026, fewer than 5% of websites have llms.txt — early adopter advantage.

### llms.txt Format

```markdown
# [Business Name]

> [One sentence: what the business does, who it serves. Under 200 chars.]

## Services
- [Service Page Title](https://domain.com/service): Description of service, key facts.

## Resources
- [Guide Title](https://domain.com/guide): What this guide covers and why it matters.

## Key Facts
- Founded in [year] by [name]
- Headquarters: [City, State]
- [X] customers/clients served in [area]
- Services: [Service A], [Service B], [Service C]

## Contact
- Website: https://domain.com
- Phone: [phone]
- Email: [email]
- Address: [full address]
```

### llms.txt Audit Checklist

| Element | Check | Severity if Missing |
|---------|-------|-------------------|
| H1 Title (matches business name) | Present? | Critical |
| Blockquote description (<200 chars) | Present? | High |
| At least one H2 section | Present? | Critical |
| 10–30 page entries with absolute URLs | Present? | High |
| Descriptions after colon (10–30 words each) | Present? | Medium |
| Key Facts section with business data | Present? | Medium |
| Contact section with email + phone | Present? | Low |
| All listed URLs return 200 | Validated? | Medium |
| llms-full.txt (extended version) | Present? | Low (nice-to-have) |

### llms.txt Scoring

| Dimension | Weight |
|-----------|--------|
| Completeness (covers all major site sections, 10–30 pages) | 40% |
| Accuracy (descriptions match page content, URLs valid) | 35% |
| Usefulness (AI could understand the business from this file alone) | 25% |

### Generation Protocol (if llms.txt missing)

1. Fetch homepage — extract site name, description, navigation links
2. Crawl sitemap for all public pages
3. Categorize pages: Services, Resources/Blog, Company, Support
4. Select 15–25 highest-value pages
5. Write 10–30 word descriptions for each (factual, specific — no marketing fluff)
6. Add Key Facts from About page, GBP, schema data
7. Output ready-to-deploy `llms.txt` file

## Section 12: Platform-Specific AI Optimization

Only **11% of domains** are cited by BOTH ChatGPT and Google AI Overviews for the same query (Terakeet 2025). Each platform has different indexes, ranking logic, and source preferences. Platform-specific optimization is required.

### Platform 1: Google AI Overviews — Key Requirements

- 92% of AIO citations come from pages already ranking in **top 10 organic** — traditional SEO is the gateway
- 47% of citations come from pages ranking **below position 5** — AIO has its own clarity-based selection logic
- Featured snippet optimization has ~70% overlap with AIO optimization

**Top actions:** Question-based H2/H3 headings, direct answer in first paragraph (40–60 words), comparison tables, ordered/unordered lists, FAQ sections, statistics with sources, visible publication + updated dates, author byline with credentials.

### Platform 2: ChatGPT Web Search — Key Requirements

- Uses **Bing's search index** (not Google)
- Top citation sources: Wikipedia (47.9%), Reddit (11.3%), YouTube, major news
- Heavily weights **entity recognition** — Wikipedia/Wikidata presence dramatically increases citation odds
- Prefers **comprehensive articles (2,000+ words)** from established sources

**Top actions:** Wikipedia/Wikidata entity, Bing Webmaster Tools registration, Reddit brand presence, authoritative .edu/.gov backlinks, consistent entity information across platforms, comprehensive long-form content.

### Platform 3: Perplexity AI — Key Requirements

- Top citation sources: **Reddit (46.7%)**, Wikipedia, YouTube, major publications
- Heaviest emphasis on **community validation** of all AI search platforms
- Cites **5–15 sources per answer** — more opportunity for mid-authority sites
- Strong freshness signal — recently updated content preferred

**Top actions:** Active Reddit presence in relevant subreddits, original research/data, discussion-friendly content, YouTube content with transcripts, freshness signals (visible dates, regular updates), cross-source claim validation.

### Platform 4: Google Gemini — Key Requirements

- Uses Google's search index + strong weighting toward **Google-owned properties** (YouTube, GBP)
- Google Knowledge Panel is a direct advantage
- Multi-modal: references images, videos, and text together
- YouTube content weighted more heavily than in standard Google Search

**Top actions:** YouTube channel with relevant content + chapters/timestamps, Google Knowledge Panel, GBP completion, comprehensive Schema.org markup, Google ecosystem presence (Scholar, News, Maps), image optimization.

### Platform 5: Bing Copilot — Key Requirements

- Uses **Bing's search index** (shared with ChatGPT but different ranking/selection)
- Supports **IndexNow protocol** for near-instant indexing
- Microsoft ecosystem integration: LinkedIn, GitHub weighted
- Bing weights meta descriptions more heavily than Google

**Top actions:** Bing Webmaster Tools verification, IndexNow implementation, LinkedIn company page, optimized meta descriptions, social engagement signals, fast page load (<2s), exact-match keywords in titles/headings.

### Cross-Platform Priority Summary

| Priority | Google AIO | ChatGPT | Perplexity | Gemini | Copilot |
|----------|-----------|---------|-----------|--------|---------|
| #1 | Top-10 ranking | Wikipedia | Reddit presence | YouTube | IndexNow |
| #2 | Q&A structure | Entity graph | Original research | Knowledge Panel | Bing WMT |
| #3 | Tables/lists | Bing SEO | Freshness | Schema.org | LinkedIn |
| #4 | Featured snippets | Reddit | Community forums | GBP | Meta descriptions |

2. Business category must exactly match query intent
3. Website must have LocalBusiness schema with areaServed matching the user's location
4. Q&A section must have keyword-relevant answers seeded

INP for AI search: Googlebot renders pages before indexing for AIO inclusion. Pages with INP >500ms may have content not fully extracted for AI citations. Target INP <200ms on all schema-rich pages.
