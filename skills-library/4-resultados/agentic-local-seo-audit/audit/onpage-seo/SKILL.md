# On-Page SEO Audit — Phase 3

## Executive Summary

On-page SEO is the highest-leverage, lowest-cost ranking lever available. Title tag + meta optimization alone can improve CTR by 20–35% within 30 days (GSC data 2024). In 2025, on-page signals have a dual role: traditional ranking AND AI Overview citation probability. Pages without direct standalone answers and FAQPage schema rarely appear in AIO. Always compare against the top-ranking competitor's on-page patterns.

## Step 1: Read Project Context

Read `{AUDIT_DIR}/intake-data.md` — business name, URL, services, location.
Read `{AUDIT_DIR}/technical-findings.md` — page indexation status, canonical issues.
Read `{AUDIT_DIR}/competitor-profiles.md` — competitor on-page patterns, title formats, schema usage.
Read `{DATA_DIR}/crawl/` — crawler output for bulk title/meta analysis.

---

## Priority Page Inventory

Audit in this order (highest business impact first):
1. Homepage
2. Primary service page(s) — one per core service
3. Location/service-area pages
4. Top-performing blog posts (by GSC impressions — filter top 10)
5. Contact page
6. About page (E-E-A-T critical)

---

## Section 1: Title Tags

### Character Limits (2025)
- **Optimal:** 50–60 characters (displays fully in desktop SERPs)
- **Mobile SERP:** 50–55 characters
- **Maximum before truncation:** 60 characters (580px pixel width)
- **Google rewrites if:** Title doesn't match page content or is < 10 characters

### Per-Page Checklist
For each key page, verify:
- [ ] Unique across the entire site? (Screaming Frog → Title → duplicates)
- [ ] Primary keyword in first 5 words?
- [ ] 50–60 characters?
- [ ] Location included for all service/location pages?
- [ ] Brand name at end (after ` | ` or ` — `)?
- [ ] Contains action word, number, or value prop for CTR?
- [ ] No keyword stuffing (same keyword repeated)?

**Optimal title formats:**
| Page Type | Format | Example |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Service page | `[Service] in [City] \| [Brand]` | `Emergency Plumber in Chicago \| Acme Plumbing` |
| Homepage | `[Brand] — [Service] in [City, State]` | `Acme Plumbing — Plumber in Chicago, IL` |
| Blog post | `[Question/Keyword] [Year] — [Brand]` | `How to Fix a Leaky Faucet 2025 — Acme Plumbing` |
| Location page | `[Service] in [City, ST] \| [Brand]` | `Drain Cleaning in Evanston, IL \| Acme` |

### AI Overviews Title Optimization
Titles that appear in AIO tend to:
- Directly match conversational query intent
- Include "How", "What", "Best", or specific quantifiers
- Signal definitive authority: "Complete Guide", "Expert Guide", "[Year] Guide"

### Competitor Title Comparison
| Page | Client Title | Competitor #1 Title | Gap |
|------|-------------|--------------------|----|
| Homepage | | | |
| Primary service | | | |
| Location page | | | |

---

## Section 2: Meta Descriptions

**Character limits:** 150–160 characters (desktop) | 130–145 characters (mobile)
**If Google rewrites 90%+ of meta descriptions:** Page content doesn't match intent — rewrite lead paragraph first.

Per-page checklist:
- [ ] Unique across site? (Screaming Frog → Meta Description → duplicates)
- [ ] 150–160 characters?
- [ ] Contains primary keyword + location (local pages)?
- [ ] Clear value proposition (WHY click this result)?
- [ ] CTA: "Call today", "Get a free quote", "Book online"?
- [ ] Phone number on high-conversion service pages?
- [ ] No passive language ("We provide..." → "Get same-day service...")?

---

## Section 3: Header Tag Hierarchy (H1–H6)

Per-page checks:
- [ ] Exactly ONE H1 per page? (Screaming Frog → H1 → filter "Multiple H1")
- [ ] H1 contains primary keyword?
- [ ] H1 is unique across the site?
- [ ] Logical hierarchy — no level skipping (H1 → H2 → H3, NOT H1 → H3)?
- [ ] H2s structure main sections with secondary keywords?
- [ ] H3s for subtopics under H2s?
- [ ] Headers descriptive, not generic ("Our Services" → "Plumbing Services in Chicago")?
- [ ] Question-format H2s/H3s for AIO citation potential?

**AIO-optimized header pattern (2025):**
```
H1: [Primary Keyword in City] — [Benefit]
  H2: What Is [Service]?  ← AIO extraction target
  H2: How Much Does [Service] Cost in [City]?  ← AIO + featured snippet
    H3: Factors Affecting [Service] Cost
  H2: Our [Service] Process  ← HowTo schema opportunity
  H2: Frequently Asked Questions  ← FAQPage schema target
    H3: [Question 1]?
    H3: [Question 2]?
```

## Section 8: AI Overviews Optimization (2025 Critical)

Pages cited in AIO score 4× the impressions of position 1 organic when AIO appears. AIO appears for 20–35% of local service queries (SparkToro 2025).

**AIO citation requirements — checklist per page:**
- [ ] Direct, standalone answer in first 40–50 words (no preamble)?
- [ ] Question-format H2/H3 headers matching common voice/conversational queries?
- [ ] Definitions: "A [service] is..." format in first paragraph?
- [ ] Specific data points (costs, timelines, measurements) stated precisely?
- [ ] Numbered step-by-step processes (HowTo schema opportunity)?
- [ ] Structured comparisons using tables?
- [ ] FAQPage schema with 5+ questions on service pages?
- [ ] Content updated within last 30 days (freshness = AIO citation bias)?
- [ ] Business rated ≥ 4.3 stars (review signal for local AIO)?

**Test:** Search target keyword → does AIO appear? Is client cited? If competitor cited but not client → content gap in answer structure.

|----------|--------|-------|
| Title tags (uniqueness, optimization, length) | 15% | /15 |
| Meta descriptions (uniqueness, CTR optimization) | 10% | /10 |
| Header hierarchy (H1 uniqueness, keyword use, AIO structure) | 10% | /10 |
| Content depth + intent satisfaction vs. competitors | 20% | /20 |

## On-Page SEO Priority Action Table

### Issue Priority by Type

| Issue Type | Impact | Feasibility | Priority | Avg Effort | Expected Lift |
|-----------|--------|-------------|----------|-----------|--------------|
| Missing FAQPage schema on service pages | 5 | 5 | 25 | 30 min/page | 3.2× AIO citation rate |
| Title tag missing primary keyword | 4 | 5 | 20 | 5 min/page | +5–15% CTR |
| Missing or duplicate H1 | 4 | 5 | 20 | 5 min/page | Crawl clarity |
| Meta description too long (>155 chars) or missing | 3 | 5 | 15 | 5 min/page | +3–8% CTR |
| Thin page content (<500 words on service page) | 5 | 3 | 15 | 4–8 hrs/page | Rankings lift |
| Missing HowTo schema on process pages | 4 | 4 | 16 | 30 min/page | Featured snippet + AIO |
| Internal links: orphaned pages (<3 inbound links) | 4 | 5 | 20 | 15 min/page | PageRank distribution |
| Image alt text missing | 3 | 5 | 15 | 30 min (bulk) | Accessibility + image search |
| Keyword cannibalization (2+ pages targeting same keyword) | 4 | 4 | 16 | 1–2 hrs | Consolidates ranking power |

### Numbered Action Plan

#### Immediate (Week 1, No Dev Required)
1. **Add FAQPage schema to all service pages** — highest ROI action: 3.2× AIO citation rate, 30 min/page, no developer needed via JSON-LD script block. Effort: 30 min/page. Priority: 25.
2. **Fix title tags** — ensure primary keyword in first 50 characters; title length 50–60 characters; unique per page. Use Screaming Frog to batch-identify. Effort: 5 min/page. Priority: 20.
3. **Fix duplicate or missing H1s** — each page must have exactly one H1. Check with Screaming Frog → filter "Missing H1" and "Multiple H1". Effort: 5 min/page. Priority: 20.
4. **Optimize meta descriptions** — 120–155 characters, includes primary keyword, has a CTA ("Call us today", "Get a free quote"). Missing meta = Google auto-generates (usually suboptimal). Effort: 5 min/page. Priority: 15.
5. **Fix orphaned pages** — run site_crawler.py → identify pages with <3 inbound internal links → add contextual links from related pages (not navigation). Effort: 15 min/page. Priority: 20.

#### Short-Term (Week 2–4, Content + Developer)
6. **Add HowTo schema to process pages** — "How to [service]" pages without HowTo schema miss featured snippet + AIO opportunities. Effort: 30 min/page. Priority: 16.
7. **Expand thin content** — service pages <800 words: expand with: local pricing context, process steps, FAQs, local testimonials, before/after. Target Surfer Score ≥70. Effort: 2–4 hrs/page. Priority: 15.
8. **Resolve keyword cannibalization** — 2+ pages targeting same keyword: pick the stronger one (more links, better CTR), 301 redirect the weaker, consolidate content. Effort: 1–2 hrs per pair. Priority: 16.
9. **Add bulk image alt text** — use Screaming Frog to export all images missing alt text → add descriptive alt text (keyword-included where relevant, descriptive always). Effort: 30 min bulk. Priority: 15.
10. **Audit and fix duplicate title tags** — Screaming Frog → filter Duplicate Title Tags → rewrite each to be unique and keyword-specific. Effort: 5 min/page. Priority: 20.
