# Core Web Vitals & Speed Audit — Phase 10

## Executive Summary

Core Web Vitals are confirmed Google ranking signals. In 2025, INP (replaced FID March 2024) is the hardest CWV metric to pass — only ~65% of sites meet Good threshold (Cloudflare 2025). Pages with all CWV in "Good" range see average 15–25% CTR improvement (Google CrUX 2024). Speed directly impacts conversion: 1-second LCP delay = 20% conversion drop (Portent 2023). Always compare client CWV against top 3 competitors.

## Step 2: Baseline CWV Data Collection

### 2025 CWV Thresholds (Updated — INP replaced FID March 2024)

| Metric | Good | Needs Improvement | Poor | Measures |
|--------|------|-------------------|------|----------|
| **LCP** (Largest Contentful Paint) | < 2.5s | 2.5–4.0s | > 4.0s | Perceived load speed |
| **INP** (Interaction to Next Paint) | < 200ms | 200–500ms | > 500ms | Responsiveness to interaction |
| **CLS** (Cumulative Layout Shift) | < 0.1 | 0.1–0.25 | > 0.25 | Visual stability |
| **TTFB** (Time to First Byte) | < 800ms | 800ms–1.8s | > 1.8s | Server responsiveness |
| **FCP** (First Contentful Paint) | < 1.8s | 1.8–3.0s | > 3.0s | Initial render |
| **TBT** (Total Blocking Time) | < 200ms | 200–600ms | > 600ms | Main thread blocking |

**INP scoring guide (2025 priority):**
- < 100ms = Excellent (competitive advantage)
- 100–200ms = Good (meets threshold)
- 200–500ms = Needs Improvement (flag for fixes)
- > 500ms = Poor (critical — likely INP veto trigger)

### Data Collection Protocol

1. **PageSpeed Insights → Mobile** (primary — Google ranks mobile-first):
   ```
   URL: https://pagespeed.web.dev/
   Test: [client URL]
   Record: Performance score, LCP, INP, CLS, TTFB, FCP, TBT
   ```

2. **PageSpeed Insights → Desktop** (secondary benchmark):
   ```
   Record same metrics — gap > 30pts Mobile vs Desktop = mobile-specific issue
   ```

3. **Top 3 Competitors** — test same URL structure (homepage):
   ```
   Record mobile performance scores for competitive benchmark table
   ```

4. **WebPageTest** (real network conditions):
   ```
   Location: nearest city to target audience
   Connection: Mobile 4G LTE
   Run: 3 tests → median result
   Record: TTFB, Start Render, Fully Loaded, Total Page Size, Total Requests
   ```

5. **Field data vs. Lab data check** (PageSpeed "Discover what your real users are experiencing"):
   ```
   CrUX field data available? Compare field vs. lab — large gaps indicate real-user outliers
   ```

---

## Section 1: LCP Optimization

### Identify LCP Element
PageSpeed Insights "Diagnostics" section identifies the LCP element automatically.

**LCP element type → fix strategy:**

| LCP Element Type | Primary Fix | Secondary Fix |
|-----------------|------------|---------------|
| Hero image | Preload + WebP/AVIF + fetchpriority="high" | Serve from CDN |
| H1 text block | Improve TTFB (server/hosting) + self-host fonts | Inline critical CSS |
| Background image (CSS) | Move to `<img>` tag to allow preload | fetchpriority="high" |
| Video thumbnail | Replace with image poster + lazy-load video | Serve from CDN |

### LCP Image Fixes (Most Common — 68% of LCP failures)
```html
<!-- Preload the LCP image in <head> -->
<link rel="preload" as="image" href="hero.webp" fetchpriority="high">

<!-- LCP img tag -->
<img src="hero.webp" width="1200" height="630"
     fetchpriority="high" loading="eager"
     alt="[descriptive alt]">
```

**Image format targets:**
- AVIF: 50–80% smaller than JPEG — ideal for LCP (Chrome + Firefox + Safari 16+)
- WebP: 25–35% smaller than JPEG — broad browser support
- Max LCP image size: ≤ 200KB (above fold, compressed)

### LCP Server Response (TTFB Fix)

If TTFB > 800ms — server is bottleneck:
| Action | Expected TTFB Improvement | Effort |
|--------|--------------------------|--------|
| Add Cloudflare (free tier) | 30–50% reduction | 30 min |
| Enable page caching (WP: WP Rocket/LiteSpeed) | 50–80% reduction | 1–2 hrs |
| Upgrade shared → VPS hosting | 40–70% reduction | 2–4 hrs |
| Move server geographically closer | 20–40% reduction | 4–8 hrs |
| Enable Brotli compression | 10–20% reduction | 30 min |

---

## Section 2: INP Optimization (2025 Priority Signal)

INP measures how quickly a page responds to user interactions (clicks, taps, keyboard input). It's the hardest CWV to fix — requires JavaScript profiling.

### Common INP Culprits

| Culprit | How to Detect | Fix | Effort |
|---------|--------------|-----|--------|
| Long tasks on main thread (>50ms) | Chrome DevTools → Performance → "Long Tasks" | Break with `scheduler.yield()` or `setTimeout(fn, 0)` | 4–16 hrs |
| Third-party scripts (chat, analytics) | DevTools → Performance → filter by domain | Delay load until after user interaction | 1–4 hrs |
| Large JavaScript bundles | DevTools → Coverage tab → unused JS | Code splitting + tree shaking | 8–24 hrs |
| Excessive DOM nodes (>1,500) | DevTools → Performance Insights | Virtualize long lists | 4–16 hrs |
| Unthrottled scroll/resize handlers | DevTools → Performance → Event Listeners | Debounce/throttle + passive listeners | 1–4 hrs |

**INP profiling command (Chrome DevTools):**
1. Open DevTools → Performance tab
2. Click "Record" → perform click/interaction on page → Stop
3. Look for "Interaction" entries in the timeline → identify blocking time

---

## Section 3: CLS Optimization

| Cause | Fix | Effort |
|-------|-----|--------|
| Images without dimensions | Add `width` and `height` to all `<img>` tags | 1–2 hrs |
| Ads / iframes without reserved space | Add `min-height` CSS container before ad loads | 2–4 hrs |
| Web fonts causing FOUT | `font-display: optional` + preload font | 1–2 hrs |
| Late-loading embeds (maps, social) | Use fixed-height skeleton placeholder | 1–4 hrs |
| Dynamically injected content above fold | Reserve space or inject only below fold | 2–8 hrs |
| CSS `animation` not using `transform` | Replace `top/margin` with `transform: translateY()` | 30 min |

---

## Section 4: Image Optimization (Highest ROI Area)

Image issues cause 60–75% of speed failures on local business sites (Screaming Frog audit data, 2024).

### Image Audit Checklist

From `python3 scripts/site_crawler.py` output + manual check:
- [ ] All above-fold images in WebP or AVIF?
- [ ] Hero/LCP image ≤ 200KB?
- [ ] Below-fold images use `loading="lazy"`?
- [ ] `srcset` defined for responsive images?
- [ ] `width` + `height` attributes on all `<img>` (prevents CLS)?
- [ ] No images served larger than display size (e.g., 2000px image at 400px display)?
- [ ] Images served from CDN (not same server as HTML)?

**Image optimization tools:**
| Tool | Purpose | Cost |
|------|---------|------|
| Squoosh (squoosh.app) | Manual WebP/AVIF conversion | Free |
| ImageOptim (Mac app) | Batch lossless compression | Free |
| TinyPNG API | Automated batch PNG/JPG compression | Free/Paid |
| Cloudinary | On-the-fly optimization + CDN | Free/Paid |
| ShortPixel (WordPress) | Auto-convert + compress on upload | Paid |

---

## Section 5: JavaScript Optimization

**JS budget targets (2025):**
- Total JS payload: < 300KB compressed
- Unused JS: < 20% of total
- Render-blocking scripts in `<head>`: 0 (except critical)
- Third-party scripts: audit any > 50ms INP impact

| Fix | Impact | Effort |
|-----|--------|--------|
| Add `defer` to non-critical scripts | Removes render-blocking | 30 min |
| Delay chat widget to user interaction | -50–200ms INP | 1–2 hrs |
| Code splitting (lazy-load by route) | -30–100KB initial JS | 8–24 hrs |
| Remove unused jQuery plugins | -20–60KB | 1–4 hrs |
| Replace social share buttons with static links | -100–400ms INP | 30 min |

---

## Section 6: Server & Infrastructure

| Check | Good | Flag |
|-------|------|------|
| Hosting type | Cloud/VPS/Managed WordPress | Shared hosting (shared = unpredictable TTFB) |
| CDN | Cloudflare / Fastly / BunnyCDN active | No CDN |
| Browser caching | `Cache-Control: max-age=31536000` for static assets | No cache headers |
| Compression | Brotli (preferred) or GZIP enabled | No compression |
| HTTP version | HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 | HTTP/1.1 (slower) |
| Server location | < 50ms latency to target audience | > 100ms to target city |

---

## Section 7: Competitor Speed Benchmark

| Metric | Client | Comp 1 | Comp 2 | Comp 3 | Target |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Mobile PSI Score | | | | | > 70 |
| LCP (mobile) | | | | | < 2.5s |
| INP (mobile) | | | | | < 200ms |
| CLS (mobile) | | | | | < 0.1 |
| TTFB | | | | | < 800ms |
| Page Size | | | | | < 2MB |

**Competitive insight:** If client's mobile score is ≥ 10 points below top competitor → speed gap is a ranking factor risk.

---

## Section 8: AI Visibility Speed Connection (2025)

AI Overviews (AIO) and voice search results strongly favor fast pages:
- AIO sources pages with LCP < 2.5s at 78% rate vs. 41% for LCP > 4s (SparkToro 2025)
- Voice search results: 97% come from pages with mobile score > 70 (Backlinko 2024)
- PageSpeed is a direct GBP ranking factor for "near me" queries (Google 2024 documentation)

Flag AIO/voice impact when speed issues are found.

---

## Priority Matrix

| Issue | Impact (1–5) | Feasibility (1–5) | Priority | Effort |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|---------|--------|
| LCP > 4s (mobile) | 5 | 4 | 20 | 2–8 hrs |
| INP > 500ms | 5 | 3 | 15 | 4–16 hrs |
| No CDN (TTFB > 1.8s) | 5 | 5 | 25 | 30 min–2 hrs |
| Images not WebP/AVIF | 4 | 5 | 20 | 2–4 hrs |
| CLS > 0.25 | 4 | 4 | 16 | 1–4 hrs |
| Render-blocking JS | 4 | 4 | 16 | 1–4 hrs |
| No browser caching | 3 | 5 | 15 | 30 min |
| Third-party script bloat | 4 | 3 | 12 | 1–4 hrs |
| No GZIP/Brotli | 3 | 5 | 15 | 30 min |

**Veto check:** LCP > 6s on mobile → maximum SERP-TRUST score capped at 30/100.

## Quick Reference: CWV Fix Priority Table

### Action Priority by Issue Type

| Issue | Root Cause | Fix | Effort | Impact |
|-------|-----------|-----|--------|--------|
| LCP >4s: render-blocking resources | CSS/JS blocking first paint | Defer non-critical JS; inline critical CSS | 2–4 hrs dev | High |
| LCP >4s: slow server TTFB | Unoptimized hosting/no CDN | Add CDN (Cloudflare free tier); enable server caching | 1–2 hrs | High |
| LCP >4s: large unoptimized image | No WebP/AVIF, no lazy load | Convert hero to WebP; add `fetchpriority="high"` on LCP image | 30 min | High |
| INP >500ms: slow event handlers | Heavy JS on user interactions | Profile with Chrome DevTools → break up long tasks (>50ms) | 4–8 hrs dev | Critical |
| INP >200ms: third-party scripts | Analytics/chat widgets blocking | Defer third-party scripts; use Partytown for off-main-thread | 2–4 hrs dev | High |
| CLS >0.25: images without dimensions | No width/height on img tags | Add `width` + `height` attributes to all images | 30 min | Medium |
| CLS >0.25: late-injected banners | Ads/cookie banners shifting layout | Reserve space with CSS `min-height`; use `contain: layout` | 1–2 hrs dev | Medium |
| TTFB >800ms: no caching | Dynamic pages not cached | Add WP Super Cache / W3 Total Cache / server-side caching | 1 hr | High |

### Numbered Action Plan (10+ Steps)

#### Immediate (Week 1, No Dev — Quick Wins)
1. **Run PageSpeed Insights** for mobile + desktop — record LCP, INP, CLS, TTFB baseline. Screenshot all scores. Effort: 10 min. Priority: 25.
2. **Compress and convert hero images to WebP** — use Squoosh.app (free) or ShortPixel → target <200KB for hero. Add `fetchpriority="high"` attribute. Effort: 30 min. Priority: 20.
3. **Add `width` and `height` to all `<img>` tags** — eliminates CLS from images. Use Screaming Frog to find missing attributes. Effort: 30 min + 1 hr dev. Priority: 20.
4. **Enable browser caching + GZIP compression** — check `.htaccess` or Nginx config. 1-line addition. Most CDNs do this automatically. Effort: 15 min. Priority: 20.
5. **Defer non-critical JavaScript** — add `defer` or `async` to all non-essential JS `<script>` tags. Doesn't require code changes, only attribute additions. Effort: 30 min. Priority: 20.

#### Short-Term (Week 2–4, Developer Involvement)
6. **Implement CDN** — Cloudflare free tier provides instant TTFB improvement globally. Set up in 1 hr. Expected TTFB drop: 200–600ms. Effort: 1 hr. Priority: 20.
7. **Profile INP with Chrome DevTools** — record → filter for Interaction events → identify long tasks >50ms → break into smaller chunks with `setTimeout(0)` or `scheduler.postTask()`. Effort: 4–8 hrs. Priority: 20.
8. **Defer or eliminate third-party scripts** — Google Tag Manager, chat widgets, and analytics are top INP killers. Load after user interaction where possible. Effort: 2–4 hrs. Priority: 16.
9. **Enable lazy loading on below-fold images** — add `loading="lazy"` to all `<img>` tags below the fold. Single attribute addition. Effort: 30 min dev. Priority: 15.
10. **Test mobile CWV separately** — Google uses mobile-first indexing. Run CrUX field data (real-user INP) vs. Lighthouse lab data. Fix the field data metric, not just the lab score. Effort: 30 min analysis. Priority: 20.

#### GBP Speed Connection (2025)
GBP links drive 25–35% of local website visits. Users arriving via GBP "Website" button have high intent — slow load (>3s) = 53% abandonment rate (Google 2025). Fast pages also rank higher in AI Overviews citation pool. Target: mobile PageSpeed score ≥90.
