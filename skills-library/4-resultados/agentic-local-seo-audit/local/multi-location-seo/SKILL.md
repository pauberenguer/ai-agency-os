# Multi-Location SEO Audit — Phase 21

## Executive Summary

Multi-location SEO is exponentially more complex than single-location — each additional location adds citation management, content differentiation, schema isolation, and cannibalization risk. In 2025, proximity weight for mobile local search increased to ~35% of local pack ranking (up from ~25% in 2023), meaning geographic optimization at each location matters more than ever. AI Overviews appear for ~35% of local service queries (Q1 2025) and pull directly from GBP data + location landing pages. Businesses with template-cloned location pages face active suppression under Google's Helpful Content System (integrated into core algorithm March 2024). The 60% unique content threshold is now a hard floor — below it = Helpful Content System penalty risk.

**2025 multi-location benchmarks per location:**
| Metric | Minimum Viable | Competitive | Market Leader |
|--------|---------------|------------|---------------|
| GBP review count | 25 reviews | 75–100 | 200+ |
| GBP review rating | 4.0 stars | 4.5 stars | 4.7–5.0 stars |
| Review velocity | 2/month | 5–8/month | 15+/month |
| GBP photos | 10 photos | 25+ photos | 50+ photos |
| Location page word count | 600 words | 1,000–1,500 words | 2,000+ words |
| Unique content vs. other pages | 60% | 80%+ | 90%+ |
| Citations per location | 40 | 75–100 | 150+ |
| NAP consistency | 85% | 95% | 99–100% |

**Numbered Action Plan:**

### Immediate (Week 1, Per-Location Wins)
1. **Run NAP consistency audit** — BrightLocal or Whitespark → check all active citations for each location → identify and flag inconsistencies (wrong address, old phone, variant business names). Effort: 30 min/location. Priority: 25 (5×5).
2. **Verify all GBPs are claimed and verified** — each location must have its own GBP with verified address. Unclaimed GBP = competitor can claim it. Effort: 30 min/location.
3. **Audit location page unique content** — Screaming Frog → compare content similarity across location pages. Any page <60% unique vs. template = HCS penalty risk. Flag for immediate rewrite. Effort: 1 hr.
4. **Check schema isolation** — each location page must have its own `LocalBusiness` schema with unique `@id`, `address`, `telephone`, `geo`. Check with Google Rich Results Test. Effort: 15 min/location.
5. **Check GBP 2025 features per location** — verify Q&A seeded with keywords, service menu complete, review velocity ≥2/month, photos ≥25. Effort: 20 min/location.

### Short-Term (Week 2–4)
6. **Fix duplicate SAP (Service Area Pages)** — any location page ranking for the same keyword in the same city = cannibalization. Implement canonical to strongest page or differentiate content significantly. Effort: 1–2 hrs.
7. **Add AI search optimization per location** — each location page needs: FAQPage schema (5 FAQ min, local questions), LocalBusiness + areaServed schema, local review AggregateRating, GBP Q&A with service + location keywords. AIO appears for ~35% of local queries. Effort: 1 hr/location.
8. **Implement `parentOrganization` schema** — each location page's `LocalBusiness` schema must include `parentOrganization` pointing to the main brand's Organization schema. This is the correct replacement for deprecated `branchOf`. Effort: 30 min dev.
9. **Build or optimize location landing pages** — each location needs: 1,000+ words unique content, local photos (not stock), local testimonials, local team/staff mention, local landmarks/context. Target Surfer Score ≥70. Effort: 4–6 hrs/location.
10. **Set up BrightLocal Grid Tracker per location** — track each location's GBP rank across 5×5 geogrid to identify proximity score gaps within the service area. Effort: 30 min setup/location. Expected: identifies which zones need additional GBP optimization.

## Applicability Check

This phase applies when the business has:
- 2+ physical addresses serving different markets
- Franchise or franchise-like multi-location model
- Service-area businesses covering 3+ distinct cities
- Plans to expand to additional locations

If single-location only: note N/A, skip this phase, award 100/100 by default.

---

## Step 1: Read Project Context

Read `{AUDIT_DIR}/intake-data.md` — confirm number of locations, business name, URL.
Read `{AUDIT_DIR}/local-findings.md` — single-location GBP/review baseline.
Read `{AUDIT_DIR}/technical-findings.md` — URL architecture and schema status.
Read `{AUDIT_DIR}/competitor-profiles.md` — competitor multi-location footprint.

**Tools for this phase:**
| Tool | Purpose | Cost |
|------|---------|------|
| **BrightLocal** | Multi-location citation management, NAP audits, GBP tracking (1–100 locations) | Paid |
| **Yext** | Centralized listing management at scale (50+ locations), real-time sync | Paid |
| **Whitespark** | Citation building per location, Local Rank Tracker grid view | Paid |
| **Local Falcon** | Geographic rank grid — visualize pack position across a city for each location | Paid |
| **Data Axle** | Primary aggregator submission — feeds 100s of directories per location | Paid |
| **PlePer Tools** | Free competitor GBP data extraction — category, attributes, photo counts | Free |
| **Google Business Profile API** | Manage 10+ locations programmatically (replaces deprecated My Business API v4.1) | Free |
| **Screaming Frog** | Crawl location pages for duplicate content, schema, internal link issues | Paid/Free |

**2025 Multi-Location Context:**
AIO (AI Overviews) appears for ~35% of local service queries as of Q1 2025, and proximity weight for mobile search increased to ~35% of the local pack algorithm. Businesses with complete, verified GBP listings at each location and strong unique content per location page are best positioned for AIO inclusion.

---

## Step 2: GBP Per-Location Audit

For EACH location, verify using **PlePer** or direct GBP Manager export:

| Check | Location 1 | Location 2 | Location 3 |
|-------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Separate GBP listing exists | ✅/❌ | ✅/❌ | ✅/❌ |
| Listing claimed & verified | ✅/❌ | ✅/❌ | ✅/❌ |
| Verified via: Postcard/Video/Email | | | |
| Unique primary category set | ✅/❌ | ✅/❌ | ✅/❌ |
| Correct unique address | ✅/❌ | ✅/❌ | ✅/❌ |
| Unique local phone number (not shared 1800) | ✅/❌ | ✅/❌ | ✅/❌ |
| Links to location-specific page (not homepage) | ✅/❌ | ✅/❌ | ✅/❌ |
| 100+ photos for location | ✅/❌ | ✅/❌ | ✅/❌ |
| Weekly GBP posts (location-specific content) | ✅/❌ | ✅/❌ | ✅/❌ |
| 20+ reviews with ≥4.3 rating | ✅/❌ | ✅/❌ | ✅/❌ |
| Q&A seeded (5+ owner answers) | ✅/❌ | ✅/❌ | ✅/❌ |
| Services/products listed | ✅/❌ | ✅/❌ | ✅/❌ |

**Photo impact:** Locations with 100+ photos receive 1,065% more website clicks vs. locations with fewer photos (Google internal data, 2024). Prioritize photo upload to all locations.

**GBP Bulk Verification (10+ locations):** Use `accounts.locations.list` endpoint via the current GBP API (v1). The legacy My Business API v4.1 is deprecated — use `mybusinessaccountmanagement.googleapis.com` instead.

**Critical:** Each GBP must link to its own dedicated location page — not the homepage. GBP Chat was deprecated July 2024 — remove any references.

## Step 3: Location Page Architecture

### URL Structure Assessment (Ranked by SEO Preference)

| Pattern | SEO Preference | When to Use |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| `domain.com/locations/chicago-il/` | ✅ Best — inherits root domain authority | Single brand, 2–50 locations |
| `domain.com/chicago-plumbing/` | ✅ Good — service + location in URL | Service-dominant businesses |
| `domain.com/locations/chicago-il/drain-cleaning/` | ✅ Best for deep service pages | Service × location matrix |
| `chicago.domain.com/` | ⚠️ Acceptable — use for franchise with distinct branding | Large franchise (50+ distinct brands) |
| `domain.com/?location=chicago` | ❌ Avoid — parameter-based, crawl issues | Never |
| `domain.com/location.php?id=3` | ❌ Avoid — no location signal in URL | Never |

**2025 recommendation:** Subdirectory (`/locations/city-state/`) preferred over subdomain (`city.domain.com/`) — subdirectory inherits full root domain authority; subdomain treated as separate site by Google.

### Per-Location Page Requirements Checklist

Each location page MUST have:
- ✅ Unique title tag: "[Primary Service] in [City, State] | [Brand]"
- ✅ Unique H1: "[Brand] [City] — [Primary Service]" or "[Service] in [City]"
- ✅ Unique meta description mentioning city + key service + differentiator
- ✅ ≥60% unique body content (hard floor — Helpful Content System penalizes templated pages)
- ✅ ≥80% unique body content (competitive benchmark in most niches)
- ✅ Location-specific content: local landmarks, neighborhoods, service area map
- ✅ Embedded Google Map showing this exact location's pin
- ✅ Location-specific NAP (Name, Address, Phone) in `<address>` tag + footer
- ✅ `LocalBusiness` schema with this location's unique data and `@id`
- ✅ `FAQPage` schema with 3–5 location-specific FAQs (AIO optimization — 35% of local queries trigger AIO)
- ✅ Location-specific reviews/testimonials from real customers in that area
- ✅ Staff photos/bios specific to that location (E-E-A-T signal)
- ✅ Location-specific CTAs (click-to-call this location's number)

### Content Differentiation Test

Run each location page pair through a diff tool (use **Siteliner** free up to 250 pages or **Copyscape**):

| Location Pair | Unique Content % | Pass/Fail | Action |
|--------------|----------------|----------|--------|
| [Loc 1 vs. Loc 2] | [X%] | ✅/❌ | |
| [Loc 1 vs. Loc 3] | [X%] | ✅/❌ | |
| [Loc 2 vs. Loc 3] | [X%] | ✅/❌ | |

**Thresholds:** <60% unique = ❌ Critical (Helpful Content penalty risk); 60–79% = ⚠️ Improve; ≥80% = ✅ Competitive

---

## Step 4: Schema — Per-Location Implementation

**IMPORTANT — 2025 Schema Change:**
`branchOf` is deprecated in Schema.org. Use `parentOrganization` instead. Update all location schemas.

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "LocalBusiness",
  "@id": "https://domain.com/locations/chicago-il/#business",
  "name": "[Brand Name] — Chicago",
  "address": {
    "@type": "PostalAddress",
    "streetAddress": "123 Main St",
    "addressLocality": "Chicago",
    "addressRegion": "IL",
    "postalCode": "60601",
    "addressCountry": "US"
  },
  "telephone": "+1-312-555-0100",
  "url": "https://domain.com/locations/chicago-il/",
  "hasMap": "https://maps.google.com/?cid=[GBP_CID]",
  "geo": {
    "@type": "GeoCoordinates",
    "latitude": 41.8781,
    "longitude": -87.6298
  },
  "openingHoursSpecification": [...],
  "parentOrganization": {
    "@type": "Organization",
    "name": "[Parent Brand Name]",
    "@id": "https://domain.com/#organization"
  },
  "areaServed": {
    "@type": "City",
    "name": "Chicago"
  }
}
```

**`@id` must be unique per location:** Use pattern `https://domain.com/locations/[city-state]/#business` — never reuse the same `@id` across locations.

**`areaServed` isolation:** Each location's schema must only include its own service area — prevents cannibalization in Google's entity model.

---

## Step 5: Internal Linking for Multi-Location

- Location hub page (`/locations/` or `/areas-we-serve/`) exists?
- Hub page links to every individual location page?
- Location pages cross-link to relevant service pages?
- Breadcrumbs: Home > Locations > [City] on all location pages?
- Footer: list all locations (if ≤ 10) or link to location hub?
- Service pages link to all relevant location pages?
- Crawl depth to location pages: ≤ 3 clicks from homepage?

Run **Screaming Frog** → Crawl Analysis → identify orphaned location pages (pages with 0 inlinks).

---

## Step 6: Local Citation Strategy Per Location

For each location, citations must use THAT location's exact NAP. Use **BrightLocal** or **Yext** to audit:

### Tier 1 — Data Aggregators (Fix First — Feed Hundreds of Directories)
| Aggregator | Location 1 Status | Location 2 Status | Fix Priority |
|-----------|------------------|------------------|-------------|
| Data Axle (infoUSA) | | | Critical |
| Neustar/Localeze | | | Critical |
| Acxiom | | | Critical |
| Foursquare (feeds Apple Maps) | | | Critical |

### Tier 2 — Core Platforms
| Platform | Loc 1 | Loc 2 | NAP Correct? |
|---------|-------|-------|-------------|
| Google Business Profile | | | |
| Apple Maps | | | |
| Bing Places | | | |
| Yelp | | | |
| Facebook | | | |
| BBB | | | |

**Common multi-location NAP errors:**
- All locations using same 1800/toll-free number (kills local relevance — each location needs unique local number)
- Citations showing old address for relocated branch
- Duplicate GBP listings for same location
- HQ address appearing on branch location citations
- NAP consistency rate target: ≥95% across all tracked citations

---

## Step 7: Cannibalization Prevention Framework

Location pages cannibalize when they compete for identical keywords without geographic separation.

### Keyword-to-URL Mapping Matrix

Build this matrix for all location × service combinations:

| Keyword | Assigned URL | Location Owner | No Other Page Targets This? |
|---------|------------|--------------|---------------------------|
| plumber chicago il | /locations/chicago-il/ | Chicago | ✅/❌ |
| plumber chicago north side | /locations/chicago-il/north-side/ | Chicago | ✅/❌ |
| plumber evanston il | /locations/evanston-il/ | Evanston | ✅/❌ |

**Detection:** Run **Ahrefs** → Site Explorer → Organic Keywords → filter for keywords where 2+ URLs rank on same page. Each keyword should have exactly one canonical page targeting it.

**Prevention rules:**
- Each location page targets geographically distinct primary keyword
- Use `areaServed` in schema to isolate geographic scope per location
- Consolidate overlapping pages with 301 redirect to the stronger location page
- Use **Local Falcon** geographic grid to identify where locations compete within same service area

---

## Step 8: Service × Location Matrix Pages

For businesses with multiple services and locations, deep service+location pages drive the most traffic:

```
domain.com/locations/chicago-il/                    ← Location hub
domain.com/locations/chicago-il/drain-cleaning/    ← Service × Location
domain.com/locations/chicago-il/water-heater/      ← Service × Location
domain.com/locations/evanston-il/drain-cleaning/   ← Service × Location
```

### Matrix Gap Analysis

| Service | Chicago | Evanston | Oak Park | % Complete |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|-----------|
| Drain Cleaning | ✅/❌ | ✅/❌ | ✅/❌ | |
| Water Heater | ✅/❌ | ✅/❌ | ✅/❌ | |
| Emergency Plumbing | ✅/❌ | ✅/❌ | ✅/❌ | |

**Priority:** High-traffic service × high-competition location combinations first. Use **Ahrefs** Keyword Explorer to validate search volume for each combination.

---

## Step 9: AIO Optimization Per Location

AI Overviews appear for ~35% of local service queries (Q1 2025). Each location page needs:

1. **FAQPage schema** with 3–5 location-specific questions (direct AIO citation trigger)
2. **Structured content:** Use H2/H3 headers that match common "near me" query patterns
3. **Review mentions:** AIO typically features businesses with ≥4.3 stars and ≥20 reviews per location
4. **Proximity data:** Precise latitude/longitude in GeoCoordinates schema
5. **Unique expertise signals:** Location-specific staff credentials, certifications, licenses displayed on page

**AIO test per location:**
Search `best [service] in [city]` in Google → does this location appear in AIO? Document status for each location.

## Step 10: Competitor Comparison

| Signal | Client (All Locs) | Comp 1 | Comp 2 | Gap |
|--------|-----------------|--------|--------|-----|
| Total locations | | | | |
| GBP completeness avg (%) | | | | |
| Avg review count per location | | | | |
| Avg rating per location | | | | |
| Location page unique content % | | | | |
| Service × location pages (count) | | | | |
| Local pack appearances (all locs) | | | | |

---

## Scoring

| Category | Weight | Score |
|----------|--------|-------|
| GBP per-location completeness (12-point checklist) | 30% | /30 |
| Location page uniqueness ≥80% (vs. 60% floor) | 25% | /25 |
| URL structure & architecture (subdirectory preferred) | 15% | /15 |
| Citation accuracy per location (Tier 1 aggregators first) | 15% | /15 |
| Cannibalization prevention (mapping matrix in place) | 10% | /10 |
| Schema per location (parentOrganization, unique @id, FAQPage) | 5% | /5 |

**Priority Matrix:**
| Action | Impact (1–5) | Feasibility (1–5) | Priority Score | Effort |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|----------------|--------|
| Fix branchOf → parentOrganization schema | 4 | 5 | 20 | 30 min/location |
| Add unique local phone per location | 5 | 4 | 20 | 1–2 hrs |
| Rewrite thin location pages (>80% unique) | 5 | 3 | 15 | 3–5 hrs/page |
| Submit Tier 1 aggregators per location | 4 | 4 | 16 | 2–4 hrs |
| Add FAQPage schema to all location pages | 4 | 5 | 20 | 30 min/page |
| Build service × location matrix pages | 5 | 3 | 15 | 4–8 hrs/page |
| Fix cannibalization via keyword mapping | 4 | 4 | 16 | 2–3 hrs |

**If single location: mark as N/A — award 100/100.**

**2025 recommendation by use case:**
- 50+ locations → Yext (only tool with real-time sync at scale)
- Agency managing multiple clients (2–15 locations each) → BrightLocal + Whitespark combination
- Single business with 2–10 locations → BrightLocal or Semrush Listing Management
- Franchise system → Data Axle + Yext combination

## SAB vs. Storefront — Critical 2025 Distinction

| Business Type | Address in GBP | Service Area Setting |
|--------------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Storefront** (customers visit) | Show address | Set service areas as supplemental |
| **Pure SAB** (no walk-ins at all locations) | Hide address | Set service area only |
| **Mixed** (some storefronts, some SABs) | Show on storefronts; hide on SABs | Per-location setting |

**2025 GBP ruling (confirmed):** SABs must NOT set service areas broader than 2-hour drive time from the business location. Google reconfirmed this via GBP Help Community Q1 2025. Violations result in Map Pack suppression.

**Critical mistake:** Hiding the address on a storefront location (where staff/customers are present) causes significant Map Pack ranking drop for proximity searches.

---

## GBP Location Groups — Management Structure (10+ Locations)

For chains with 10+ locations, use proper account hierarchy:
```
Owner Account (1 account only)
  └── Location Group 1 (Region A)
      ├── Manager Account (Regional Manager)
      └── Individual GBP listings (locations in Region A)
  └── Location Group 2 (Region B)
      ├── Manager Account (Regional Manager)
      └── Individual GBP listings (locations in Region B)
```

**Rules:**
- Maximum 20 manager accounts per location group (more triggers spam flags)
- Bulk verification threshold: 10+ locations via GBP API `accounts.locations.list`
- Never add more than 1 owner account — ownership conflicts cause verification suspension
- Use `updateMask` in GBP API to bulk-update specific fields (hours, services, photos) without full listing resubmission

## Common 2025 Multi-Location Mistakes (Top 10)

| # | Mistake | Impact | Fix | Effort |
|---|---------|--------|-----|--------|
| 1 | Template-cloned location pages (<60% unique) | HCS penalty, page 4+ rankings | Rewrite with location-specific content | 3–5 hrs/page |
| 2 | Same phone number across all locations | Duplicate signal, local relevance loss | Assign unique local number per location | 1–2 hrs |
| 3 | GBP links to homepage (not location page) | Map Pack click-through loss | Update GBP website URL to `/locations/city-state/` | 5 min/location |
| 4 | `branchOf` schema (deprecated 2025) | Entity graph confusion | Replace with `parentOrganization` | 30 min/location |
| 5 | Same `@id` value across all location schemas | Google cannot distinguish locations | Use unique `@id` per location URL fragment | 30 min/location |
| 6 | GBP Q&A left unmanaged | Misinformation damages conversion | Seed 5–10 Q&As + answer within 24hrs | 30 min/location |
| 7 | Service areas overlap between locations | Cannibalization in entity model | Assign distinct `areaServed` per location schema | 30 min/location |
| 8 | No UTM on GBP website URL | Cannot measure GBP traffic per location in GA4 | Add `?utm_source=gmb&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=[city]-gbp` | 5 min/location |
| 9 | Orphaned location pages (0 internal links) | Not crawled/indexed | Add to hub + sitemap + breadcrumb | 30 min/page |
| 10 | Review gating (only asking happy customers) | FTC violation (2025) + GBP suspension risk | Send requests to all customers | Policy change |

---

## GBP Website URL — UTM Parameter Template

For each location's GBP "Website" field, use:
```
https://domain.com/locations/[city-state]/?utm_source=gmb&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=[city]-gbp
```
This enables GA4 to measure GBP-specific traffic per location — essential for proving ROI at the location level.
