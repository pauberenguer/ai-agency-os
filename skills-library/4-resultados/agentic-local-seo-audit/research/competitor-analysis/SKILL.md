# Competitor Deep Analysis — Phase 1

## Executive Summary

Competitor analysis is the intelligence layer that makes every subsequent phase actionable. Without knowing what the top-ranking competitors do, every recommendation is directionally blind. This phase profiles 3–5 competitors across 9 dimensions in enough depth that all subsequent phases can benchmark findings against real competitor data. Time investment: 45–90 minutes produces data that informs 20+ recommendations across the audit.

**2025 competitive landscape shift:** AI Overviews appear for 20–35% of local service queries — competitors who are cited by AIO have invisible traffic advantages that traditional ranking data doesn't show. This phase must audit AI visibility, not just organic rankings.

## Step 1: Read Project Context

Read `{AUDIT_DIR}/intake-data.md` — business name, URL, services, location, competitor list.

**If competitors not provided in intake, use this 3-search identification protocol:**
1. Google: `[primary service] [city]` → note top 3 local pack + top 3 non-directory organic
2. Google: `best [service] [city]` → cross-reference, add new names
3. Google: `[service] [city] reviews` → identify any additional local leaders

Confirm each competitor:
- Actually ranks for target keywords in target city (not a national brand with one page)
- Has a website (not just a GBP listing)
- Competes on primary services (not just adjacent services)

Present findings: "I've identified these top competitors: [list]. Please confirm or swap any."

## Step 2: Analyze Each Competitor Across All 9 Dimensions

For 3–5 competitors, systematically research each dimension. **Do NOT guess — verify with web search, page fetch, and public data tools.**

---

## Dimension 1: Business Profile

| Data Point | How to Find | Comp 1 | Comp 2 | Comp 3 |
|-----------|------------|--------|--------|--------|
| Business type (independent/chain/franchise) | Website + Google Maps | | | |
| Domain age | Whois / BuiltWith | | | |
| Years in business | About page / GBP | | | |
| Indexed pages (`site:[domain]`) | Google search | | | |
| Tech stack (CMS) | BuiltWith | | | |
| Service areas (same/broader/narrower) | Website + GBP | | | |
| # of locations | Google Maps search | | | |
| Estimated team size | LinkedIn Company page | | | |

## Dimension 2: Technical SEO Profile

**CWV benchmarks (2025 — INP replaced FID March 2024):**

| Metric | Good | Comp 1 | Comp 2 | Comp 3 | Client |
|--------|------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Mobile PSI Score | > 70 | | | | |
| LCP (mobile) | < 2.5s | | | | |
| INP (mobile) | < 200ms | | | | |
| CLS (mobile) | < 0.1 | | | | |
| TTFB | < 800ms | | | | |

**Additional technical checks per competitor:**
- HTTPS: valid SSL? ✅/❌
- Schema types (Google Rich Results Test): list all present
- URL structure: logical hierarchy? Keyword-inclusive slugs?
- Site architecture depth (service pages: 2-3 clicks from homepage = good)
- Mobile responsive: test at 375px viewport

---

## Dimension 3: Content Strategy

For each competitor (Ahrefs → Site Explorer → Organic Pages → sort by traffic):

| Data Point | Comp 1 | Comp 2 | Comp 3 |
|-----------|--------|--------|--------|
| Total pages estimated (`site:` count) | | | |
| Service pages count | | | |
| Location pages count | | | |

| Unique content assets (tools, guides, calculators) | | | |
| Local content (city guides, neighborhood pages) | | | |
| FAQPage schema present on service pages | | | |
| Content freshness (last updated on key pages) | | | |

**Content depth benchmark (2025 HCS standards):**
- Service page < 800 words = substandard

- Blog post < 1,200 words = thin
- Pillar blog 2,500+ words = authoritative
