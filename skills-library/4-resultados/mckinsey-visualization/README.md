# Strategy Consulting Visualization Skill

**Messy notes in. Board-ready slides out.**

One skill for your AI agent: turn notes, metrics, and prose into consulting-grade visuals — as real SVG slides, as an **animated HTML deck**, or as a spec any designer or tool can execute.

Python 3 standard library only. **Zero dependencies. Zero API keys. Zero network calls.**

![Six-slide board deck rendered by this skill](assets/readme/demo.gif)

_An actual deck built by this repo: `specs (JSON) → SVG slides → animated HTML deck`. Nothing hand-drawn._
_Reproduce it: `python3 scripts/scaffold_deck.py board-update -o demo && python3 scripts/build_html_deck.py --manifest demo/deck.json -o demo/deck.html`_

</div>

## Why This Gets Starred

- **Install it and get a complete deck immediately.** `scripts/scaffold_deck.py <archetype>` copies a full, coherent 9-12 slide deck — cover through closing — into a working directory. Swap the illustrative data for yours and build. Six archetypes ship, one in Japanese.
- **It actually renders.** 22 patterns produce real SVG slides — waterfall, executive summary, 2×2, scatter, heatmap, Gantt, small multiples, cover, section dividers, agendas, closings, and more. Every gallery image below is committed renderer output, verified fresh by CI on every push.
- **Animated HTML decks from one command.** Combine slides into a single self-contained HTML file: quiet staggered reveals, keyboard navigation, progress bar, zero external requests. Press `p` → your browser prints it → **you have a PDF**.
- **A browser-native report mode.** `scripts/build_html_report.py` turns Markdown into a self-contained, print-to-A4 HTML document with numbered exhibits — the same visual system, for documents instead of decks.
- **Works with your slide tools.** The SVGs drop straight into **PowerPoint, Keynote, and Word** (Insert → Picture). For Google Slides, export PNG from any browser first.
- **Japanese business documents are first-class.** CJK text wraps correctly (measured per fullwidth character, not by spaces), fonts fall back to Noto Sans JP / Hiragino, and there are dedicated profiles for 稟議書, 役員会資料, 週報, 学会抄録.
- **Charts that survive an audit.** Bar proportions match the data (Lie Factor ≈ 1.0), zero baselines are marked, cell text passes WCAG AA contrast across the whole color ramp, and the accent navy stays readable in greyscale print — all of it **asserted in the test suite**, not promised in prose.
- **Roasted by five design legends, then fixed.** We ran the whole system through a five-perspective design panel — Tufte's data-ink discipline, an ex-McKinsey chart master, Swiss grid typography, FT-style data journalism, and modern design engineering. They scored it 5.8/10 and listed every flaw. A previous release shipped every fix. [Read the receipts.](#roasted-by-five-design-legends)

## 60-Second Start

```bash
# 1. Install it as an agent skill (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, and 70+ agents)
npx skills add kgraph57/mckinsey-style-visualization-skill
```

Or clone it directly (also gets you the runnable scripts below):

```bash
# 1. Get it (Claude Code clone install)
git clone https://github.com/kgraph57/mckinsey-style-visualization-skill.git ~/.claude/skills/strategy-consulting-visualization
cd ~/.claude/skills/strategy-consulting-visualization

# 2. Render one slide → SVG
python3 scripts/render_slide_spec.py examples/render-specs/arr-waterfall.json -o slide.svg

# 3. Build the full animated deck → one HTML file
python3 scripts/build_html_deck.py --manifest examples/demo-deck.json -o deck.html
open deck.html   # ← arrows to navigate, "p" to print → PDF
```

Or skip the terminal and just ask your agent:

```text
Use the strategy consulting visualization skill to turn these notes into a board slide:
ARR grew from $10M to $15M. Enterprise added $3M, expansion $2.5M, churn -$0.5M.
The board must decide on implementation capacity investment.
```

## The Pipeline

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A["Messy notes,<br/>metrics, prose"] --> B["Slide spec<br/>(JSON)"]
    B --> C["SVG slides"]
    C --> D["Animated HTML deck"]
    C --> E["PowerPoint / Keynote / Word<br/>(insert SVG)"]
    D --> F["PDF<br/>(browser print)"]
```

Specs are plain JSON, so they diff, review, and version like code. The renderer and deck builder are single-file Python scripts with no installs.

## Gallery

Every image is committed output of `scripts/render_slide_spec.py` — CI fails if any of them drifts from what the renderer actually produces. Specs live in [examples/render-specs/](examples/render-specs).

| ARR Waterfall                                                | Executive Summary Strip                                              |

**22 patterns render to SVG**: `cover`, `section_divider`, `end_cover`, `agenda`, `bullet_list`, `closing`, `quote`, `waterfall`, `gap`, `before_after`, `time_series`, `benchmark_table`, `summary_strip`, `process_flow`, `funnel`, `heatmap`, `gantt`, `kpi_scorecard`, `two_by_two`, `scatter`, `distribution`, `small_multiples`. Thirteen more patterns (Sankey, pyramid, maps, decision trees, …) ship as structured specs and image-generation prompts — [the catalog says exactly which is which](references/visualization-patterns.md). We don't pretend.

## Animated HTML Decks

```bash
python3 scripts/build_html_deck.py cover.json bridge.json summary.json -o deck.html --title "Q4 Review"
```

One command, one file, and you get:

- **Quiet, staggered element reveals** on every slide — the restrained kind, not slide-carnival transitions (`prefers-reduced-motion` respected)
- **Keyboard + click navigation**, progress bar, slide counter, deep links (`deck.html#3`)
- **Print stylesheet**: `p` or Cmd+P gives you one slide per page → save as **PDF**
- **Zero external requests** — fonts, styles, scripts, and SVGs are all inline. Email it, host it, present offline.

Try the committed demo: [examples/demo-deck.html](examples/demo-deck.html) (open locally after cloning).

## Instant Deck: Scaffold → Build

Skip writing specs from a blank page. Pick an archetype, copy it, swap in real data:

```bash
python3 scripts/scaffold_deck.py --list                    # see all 6 archetypes + slide counts
python3 scripts/scaffold_deck.py board-update -o my-deck --title "FY27 Board Update"
# edit my-deck/specs/*.json with real numbers — the pattern shapes are already right
python3 scripts/build_html_deck.py --manifest my-deck/deck.json -o my-deck/deck.html
```

`scaffold_deck.py` refuses to overwrite a non-empty directory unless you pass `--force`, and prints the next two commands when it's done.

## Template Gallery

Six deck archetypes ship pre-filled with a coherent illustrative storyline — every slide renders, nothing is a stub.

| Archetype                 | Use For                                    | Storyline                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `board-update`            | Recurring board / steering updates         | Cover → agenda → executive summary → KPI scorecard → ARR waterfall → trend → risk view → closing → end cover                                         |
| `strategy-recommendation` | "Where to play, how to win" strategy decks | Cover → agenda → context → two section dividers (Where to play / How to win) → 2×2 → benchmark table → gap or bridge → roadmap → closing → end cover |
| `project-status`          | PMO / steering-committee status reviews    | Cover → summary → roadmap → KPI scorecard → blockers → path-to-green flow → closing → end cover                                                      |
| `market-entry`            | Entry or expansion investment cases        | Cover → agenda → market trend → competitor benchmark → segment 2×2 → entry-path flow → distribution or scatter → closing → end cover                 |
| `sales-proposal`          | Customer-facing proposals                  | Cover → client situation → before/after → approach flow → plan → why-us benchmark → customer quote → closing → end cover                             |
| `board-update-ja`         | 役員会向け月次アップデート（日本語）       | `board-update` と同じ構成を、翻訳調ではなく自然な日本語の見出しで                                                                                    |

## Report Mode: Markdown → Browser Document

For a document instead of a deck, write Markdown and build it straight to a single self-contained, print-to-A4 HTML report:

```bash
python3 scripts/build_html_report.py my-report.md -o my-report.html --lang en
```

- Front matter (`title`, `subtitle`, `author`, `date`, `classification`, `lang`) drives a navy title band — the only navy surface in the document.
- `##`/`###` headings auto-number and build a "Contents" TOC with anchor links; standard Markdown (bullets, ordered lists, tables, bold/italic, code, blockquotes, links) renders as clean editorial typography — everything HTML-escaped first, so nothing in the source can inject markup.
- Drop in a rendered chart with `![Caption](spec:path/to/spec.json)` — it becomes an auto-numbered `Exhibit N — Caption` with the full slide SVG embedded inline, no header/footer chrome needed. `![Caption](svg:path.svg)` embeds an existing SVG file the same way.
- `p` / Cmd+P exports an A4-portrait PDF with the title band as the first page.
- Zero external requests — same self-contained guarantee as the HTML deck.

Three starting points ship in `templates/reports/`: `board-pre-read.md`, `one-pager.md`, `proposal-memo.md`. See the committed demo: [examples/demo-report.html](examples/demo-report.html) (built from [examples/demo-report.md](examples/demo-report.md)).

## Speaker Script: What You Read at the Podium

Any slide spec can carry a top-level `"notes"` field — a string, or a list of paragraph strings — holding the spoken narration for that slide. The SVG renderer ignores it completely, so adding notes never changes a rendered slide. Build the same deck manifest into a print-first, one-slide-per-page script:

```bash
python3 scripts/build_speaker_script.py --manifest my-deck/deck.json -o my-deck/script.html --lang en
```

- One printed A4 page per slide: the slide rendered inline above, the narration in podium-readable type below (screen 20px, print ~13.5pt; `--lang ja` loosens line-height to 1.9 with `palt` for CJK).
- A slide with no notes still gets its own page, with a muted "(no script)" / "（原稿なし）" marker — never silently skipped.
- A cover page carries the deck title and the date from the deck's own cover slide, if present.
- Zero external requests, no required JavaScript.

See the committed demo: [examples/demo-script.html](examples/demo-script.html) (built with `--lang ja` from [templates/decks/board-update-ja/deck.json](templates/decks/board-update-ja/deck.json)).

## Deck as an Article: Read It Top to Bottom Like a Web Page

The same `notes` field also drives a reading-mode build: the whole deck laid out vertically on a single 680px column, each slide's SVG followed by its narration as prose — a paper-first article, like a published M3-series piece, not a side-nav document.

```bash
python3 scripts/build_html_article.py --manifest my-deck/deck.json -o my-deck/article.html --lang en
```

- A hero opens the page: an optional uppercase kicker from the manifest's `series` key, the title, an optional lead paragraph from `lead` (falling back to `description` for older manifests), and meta chips for slide count, presenter, and date (from the deck's cover slide).
- Every slide appears, in manifest order, as its own `<article>` on the full 680px column — meta line (number + optional per-spec `label`), heading, SVG, then its notes as prose. There is no "Contents" jump list in this mode; it is a single linear scroll.
- A slide with no notes renders frame-only — the article still shows every slide, like flipping through the deck.
- Optional per-slide `refs` (`[{"label": ..., "url": ...}]`) render as a "Links" aside below the notes and roll up, deduped by URL, into an "All links" section after the last slide; only http(s)/mailto URLs render as links.
- `--title` overrides the manifest title; zero external requests except the `href` of a ref link itself.

See the committed demo: [examples/demo-article.html](examples/demo-article.html) (built from [templates/decks/board-update/deck.json](templates/decks/board-update/deck.json)).

## Roasted by Five Design Legends

Most chart generators say "beautiful". We wanted **defensible**, so we convened a five-perspective design review panel (as rigorous AI personas) and told them to be merciless:

| Reviewer lens                                    | Verdict | Sharpest cut                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Edward Tufte — data-ink, honest scales           | 5.5/10  | "Meaningless decorated rectangles baked into the renderer"          |
| Gene Zelazny — ex-McKinsey, _Say It With Charts_ | 6.5/10  | "The flagship example violates its own headline rule"               |
| Vignelli × Müller-Brockmann — Swiss grid         | 6/10    | "A corporate template, not a design system"                         |
| Alan Smith — FT data journalism                  | 5.5/10  | "The waterfall draws off-canvas on negative bridges" (he proved it) |
| Modern design engineering                        | 5.5/10  | "2016 visuals wearing a 2020s spec sheet"                           |

Then we shipped **every fix** in [a prior release](CHANGELOG.md): zero-floor waterfalls, CJK-correct wrapping, no silent truncation, a single re-derived navy that survives greyscale printing, diverging heatmaps for signed data, WCAG-AA cell text asserted across the entire ramp, decoration stripped, a comparison-type gate before every chart choice, and a rubric that now measures data-ink integrity and deck-level storyline logic.

The result is a visual system you can defend in front of a board, an auditor, or a design critic — because it already survived one.

## The Discipline Under the Hood

The renderer is the visible part. The skill underneath is a full operating system for executive visualization:

- **Message first**: every visual starts from the reader's decision, gets a single-proposition insight headline, and only then picks a chart — gated by the five comparison types (component / item / time series / distribution / correlation).
- **A real style system**: [design tokens on an 8px grid, a fixed type scale, one navy, an emphasis ladder (fill > line > text) with hard caps](references/style-system.md) — the same constants the renderer executes.
- **A quality rubric with teeth**: [24-point scoring](references/quality-rubric.md) across strategy, data integrity, data-ink honesty, hierarchy, portability, and safety, plus blocking gates (no color-only meaning, no invented data, no implied rendering that doesn't exist).
- **An adversarial review loop**: [expert lenses](references/expert-review-loop.md) that hunt overclaims, insider jargon, accessibility failures, and cultural assumptions before anything is called publishable.

## By Role

The [persona playbook](references/persona-playbook.md) gives every role a copy-paste prompt and a rendered example:

| Role                   | Ask For                          | Rendered Example                                                             |

Japanese business formats (稟議書, 週報・月報, 役員会資料, 学会抄録, 提案書) have dedicated profiles in [document-type-profiles.md](references/document-type-profiles.md).

## One-Minute Example

Give the skill this:

```text
ARR grew from $10M to $15M.
Enterprise expansion contributed $3M. Existing customers added $2.5M. Churn cost $0.5M.
AI workflow adoption grew from 18% to 64%.
The board needs to decide whether to invest in implementation capacity.
```

It returns a decision-framed spec — strategic question, single-proposition headline, pattern choice with reasoning, exact values and labels, assumptions, and a rubric score — that renders to the waterfall you saw in the gallery. See the full worked proof: [input](examples/board-update-input.md) → [slide specs](examples/board-update-slide-spec.md) → [evaluation](examples/evaluation-report.md).

### Case Study: the full loop in two minutes

**[SaaS Board Update — Raw Notes to a Board-Ready Slide](examples/case-studies/saas-board-update.md)** walks one real pass end to end: anonymized founder notes → weak first draft → the packaged reviewer rejects it (14/20) → decision-first revision passes (20/20) → the committed rendered slides. Every artifact is in this repo and reproducible with two commands.

## What You Can Point It At

| Starting Point               | You Get                                                     |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Board update metrics         | 5-slide story: cover, waterfall, trend, gap, recommendation |
| Revenue bridge data          | Waterfall with drivers, honest baselines, assumptions       |
| Competitor / vendor data     | Benchmark table + 2×2 positioning with leader highlights    |
| KPI before/after data        | Impact slide with deltas and an implication headline        |
| Process description / SOP    | Process flow with owners and the bottleneck highlighted     |
| Segment metrics over time    | Small-multiples grid on one honest shared scale             |
| Research notes / whitepaper  | Numbered report figures with sources and distributions      |
| Any prose — "visualize this" | Input triage → right pattern → document profile → spec      |

## Install

```bash
# Skills CLI (skills.sh) — works with Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, and 70+ agents
npx skills add kgraph57/mckinsey-style-visualization-skill
```

Alternative — Claude Code clone install:

```bash
# Personal skill (Claude Code)
git clone https://github.com/kgraph57/mckinsey-style-visualization-skill.git ~/.claude/skills/strategy-consulting-visualization

# Project skill
git clone https://github.com/kgraph57/mckinsey-style-visualization-skill.git .claude/skills/strategy-consulting-visualization
```

Verify the package (same checks CI runs):

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests
python3 scripts/validate_skill.py   # → OK: skill package passed validation
```

The validator re-renders every committed SVG and the demo deck from source specs and fails on any drift — the gallery cannot silently rot.

## Star It, Break It, Share It

If this turned your rough notes into a usable slide, **star the repo** — stars are how other people find tools that actually render instead of hallucinate.

Even better contributions:

- A messy input and the slide it produced ([Discussions](https://github.com/kgraph57/mckinsey-style-visualization-skill/discussions))
- A business scenario that needs a pattern we don't have ([request template](https://github.com/kgraph57/mckinsey-style-visualization-skill/issues/new?template=example_request.md))
- An output that's broken, confusing, or overconfident — it becomes a regression test
